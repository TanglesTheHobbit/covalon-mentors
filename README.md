Covalon Mentors Module

Buckle up fuckos we're on a crash course to learning how the fuck github works and it's the blind leading the blind. 

When you wanna update the mentors module you need to follow these steps:

1. Complete all of the updates you need to make in Foundry. Update actor sheets, images, etc. 
2. Export all of these updated actor sheets into a compendium !!THE NAME MUST MATCH THE module.json FORMAT - SEE LATER!!
3. Navigate to your foundryVTT modules folder for covalon-mentors (User/AppData/Local/FoundryVTT/Data/Modules/covalon-mentors
4. Upload the contents of the images and packs folder to the images and packs folders in the github repository. 
5. update the module.json by editing it to increment the version number. 
6. go to Releases and create a new release. 
7. Add a tag that matches the version number inside the module.json (e.g v2.3)
8. Add a title that matches the version number inside the module.json (e.g v2.3)
9. Add patch notes for the changes that have been made
10. Publish Release - WHEN YOU PRESS THIS IT GETS PUSHED TO ALL MODULE USERS WHEN THEY UPDATE

Great Arto, but you didn't fucking explain the module.json format that you put in all caps or whatever. Idiot

When there is a new folder added in Foundry (For example for T3 mentors) you need to add a new section in the "packs" inside the module.json.
Make sure they are named correctly or it will break. https://i.imgur.com/9Gc663Q.png

You can copy paste the t1 or t2 part and just change the names.
